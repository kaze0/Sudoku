<b>Some notes about dg Sudoku A Day</b>
<ul>
<li>First off, welcome to the game!</li>
<li>One of the big downfalls to many sudoku games is that you eventually run out of games. And even if you ca add or import more games, it's an annoyance. You won't have to worry about it any longer though.</li>
<li>A one button check will pull down your Sudoku games for the day!</li>
